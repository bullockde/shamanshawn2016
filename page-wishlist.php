			<p>Shawn gives an excellent massage. He uses very therapeutic gliding strokes that left me more relaxed than I’ve felt in some time. He worked all the muscle groups, leaving me standing straighter, as well as feeling taller. I carry a lot of tension in my body, and the massage relaxed me and lessened the tension in a major way. He also did a lot of good work on my lower back, which is my trouble area. I will definitely be back to see Shawn again in the near future.</p>

                  <p>Had a terrific massage from Shawn a few weeks ago. It had been a really intense week and I must say it was what I needed. It was professional, therapeutic and very relaxing - to the point where I fell in and out of sleep and relaxation. Shawn is professional, talented and to his credit very knowledgeable with regard to the human body, the negative impact of stress and how to balance and manage that with exclusive massage techniques. Truly has healing hands. I recommend him to all interested in experiencing one of the best massages ever!</p>

                  <p>At first I was very apprehensive about meeting Shawn. This was my very first massage and I was not sure what to expect. After meting him and having such a positive experience, I can assure you it will not be my last. Shawn was very professional from the beginning. The setting was perfect for a relaxing experience. I think Shawn knew I was nervous and he initiated conversation to make me feel at ease. I was pleased with the massage and at times I felt like I was drifting off. I have not been this relaxed in ages. I will definitely use Shawn again and I highly recommend that you do to.</p>
