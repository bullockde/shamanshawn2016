		<p>It has been proven scientifically that coaching improves people’s performance, their feeling of responsibility and the overall way people carry themselves. Coaching focuses on your habits, your way of thinking and the way you deal with your emotions.</p>

		<p>I am aware that coaching is a very broad term, and that there are alot of coaches out there. On this page you’ll find out what sets me apart from other regular ‘life coaches’.</p>

		<p>I am specialized in Personal Transformation, and the model I use for my coaching is called ‘SHAME2FAME’.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions, you can check the F.A.Q. section at the bottom of this page, or <a href='/contact/'>send me a message</a>.</p>

		<h3>What Can Be Achieved With SHAME2FAME Coaching? </h3>
		<center><small><i>I am aware of the fact that every client is unique – Results are based on the average client.</i></small></center>
<br><br>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<b>Become Happier</b><br>
Who doesn’t want to be happy with themselves? I know I do. Accepting yourself as you are is a big step forward towards a happy life. Is there a specific area of life that you’re not satisfied with? We’ll work on it.
</div>
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<b>Deal With Your Environment</b><br>
Everyone is entitled to their opinion. You are someone on a mission. Not everyone will understand you. Sometimes the opinions of others can cause you to lose focus. I help with this.
</div>
<div class='clear'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<b>Become A Leader</b><br>
Are you capable of leading yourself? If you aren’t, you won’t be able to lead others. Become decisive, be creative, and show determination and people will start following you. It’s time to think for yourself.
</div>
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<b>Break Through Limits</b><br>
No more holding yourself back with your current beliefs. It’s time for a different outlook on your life. At least for those who want to get some altitude. Warning: you may be shocked to see what the possibilities.
</div>
<div class='clear'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<b>Become Indispensable</b><br>
Do people miss you when you’re not around at work? Or are you easily replaced by someone else? I will help you become indispensable to your boss, to your colleagues, anyone that makes use of your time.
</div>
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-6'>
<b>Boost Self-Esteem</b><br>
Your self-esteem affects everything you do, it’s the #1 factor that determines success. If you like yourself, rate yourself highly, view yourself as worthy: you will be so much more effective (and attractive!).

Situation #1<br>
I have tried everything, but I can’t seem to get the job done (on my own, at least).
</div>	
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-4'>		
Situation #2<br>
I am often unsure of myself. I sometimes think I’m no good. No one knows this.
</div>	
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-4'>		
Situation #3<br>
I lost track of where I’m going in life. Time seems to be flying me by. Where will I end up?
</div>	

<div class='clear'><br><br></div>

<div class='col-md-4'>		
Situation #4<br>
I feel like I’m a jack of all trades. I’m not that good in anything really, I drift from idea to idea.
</div>	
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-4'>		
Situation #5<br>
I’m not privileged like rich kids. If only I had more money or resources, than I’d be better off.
</div>	
<div class='clear visible-xs'><br><br></div>
<div class='col-md-4'>	
Situation #6<br>
The opposite sex doesn’t pay attention to me. I’m invisible to all people sometimes. This hurts, alot
